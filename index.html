    <h1>Why Pink Erasers?</h1>
    <img src="images/main.png" alt="drawing of pink eraser">
    
    <p>Throughout my education which lead me to higher education, I have interacted with five types of erasers. I have used black erasers, pure white erasers, a white-blue eraser, mechanical pencil erasers and the pink eraser. I will now explain why the pink eraser is of superior value and practical use.</p>
    <p>By the very nature of erasers, they are the object of constant use and by extension misplacement. It takes years of careful observation and analysis to join the elite who do not lose their eraser. This natural fact makes it imperative that erasers be replaceable.</p>
    <p>Bearing that in mind, the purpose of the eraser should not be ignored. Some might say the purpose of an eraser is to erase mistakes. While that is true, it is incomplete. An eraser helps us transcend our mistakes not just hide them. This means that an eraser that smears the page is inadequate. This also means that one that produces thick or uncooperative shavings which cannot be easily blown away is inadequate. This is because if blowing them off is not a good option you would need to push them side with the back of your hand and this will result in possible smearing and that is an unnecessary risk.</p>
    <p>To summarize, what we care about in an eraser is </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>affordability,</li>
	<li>absorbing potential (does it tend to become greasy easily) and </li>
	<li>shape, elasticity and sticking potential of shavings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Considering the above factors, we arrive at the conclusion that <a href=" https://www.amazon.com/GEAR-Smudge-Proof-Pink-Erasers-Count/dp/B0751YPS4F">pink erasers</a> are the most suitable choice of all erasers. They are cheap; hence, they are replaceable. They effectively and consistently leave a clean page behind. Finally, they are humble; they do not flaunt brand names or useless paper wrapping. That is what makes them the best. </p>
